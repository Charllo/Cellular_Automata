This was originally an attempt to create a cellular automaton that simulates
how ink would spread over paper. I'm not sure if it looks like that, but it
is definitely good at producing random 2d "maps" that could be either seen as
top-down maps or side-view maps (e.g. a Rimworld map or a Terraria map)
